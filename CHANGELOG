Change log Oct 10, 2014

- Chat:
1. External observer now has MessageType, message, username and timestamp parameters;
2. Added automake.

- Conference discovery:
1. External observer now has MessageType, message, and timestamp parameters;
2. Added conference information (factory) interface (serialization, deserialization interface );
3. Added automake;
4. Explicit conference over announcement, by replying to one's heartbeat interest with 'over' message;
5. Changed to using a row of heartbeat timeouts for detecting conference drop;
6. (Not yet implemented) Use random string for actual conference name, I'm still thinking about this part's relationship with conference info serialization interface.
